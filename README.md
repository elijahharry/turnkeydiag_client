# TurnKey Diagnostics
Hired to create this website for a diagnostics company. No server was utilized, was primarily focused on design. The website does utilize a hidden Wordpress blog as a "headless" CMS, my client can create their own blog posts, which get grabbed via GraphQL in getStaticProps and seamlessly displayed on the frontend in a super-fast, static NextJS build.
