PCR provides the greatest sensitivity and specificity with the ability to rapidly detect and differentiate 98-99% of the most common aerobic, anaerobic, and facultative bacteria, viral and fungal targets, and polymicrobial infections. Our universal medium eliminates the need for specialized live sample handling or storage by safely inactivating and stabilizing the sample in transport for subsequent analysis. This reduces the impact of transport time and cost.",

Due to identifying the bacteria DNA, your team can properly diagnose and prescribe the antibacterial medication in alignment with the bacteria on the skin. Allowing you to not prescribe a medication that wonâ€™t work or overmedicating.  ",

Some are to help it heal with others are or will turn into an infection. We get ahead of it by swabbing it. Our test is 99% effective and accurate in identifying genetically what the cause and source of this are.",
