        "Family doctors, internal medicine physicians and pediatricians frequently order our infectious diseases tests for bacteria and viruses causes of infection in the upper respiratory and lower respiratory (pneumonia microorganisms). Unlike rapid assays commonly performed in clinics and doctors’ offices, our panel is inordinately more sensitive, more specific and does not rely on a healthcare provider’s assumptions or knowledge about the seasonality of viruses.",
        "PCR provides a more definitive diagnosis than the POC antigen assays and is 3-5X more sensitive than conventional culture techniques. The short run-time of PCR allows our lab to produce both pathogen and antibiotic resistance results within 24 hours of specimen collection.",
        "The use of rapid antigen detection tests become popular but is still very limited due to the low sensitivity and focus on single pathogen diagnosis. These rapid antigen tests may also create a false sense of security for both the patient and the provider when relied upon as a confirmatory test. Our solution is rapid and accurate eliminating the guesswork in diagnosing respiratory infections.",
        "Many common respiratory pathogens (viral and bacterial) have similar clinical presentation, making diagnosis based on symptoms alone very difficult. Influenza viruses commonly cause respiratory illness, but many other pathogens may cause significant impact on patient health as well.",
