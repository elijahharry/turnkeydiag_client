        "Blood tests are the analysis of a blood sample done in a laboratory to identify underlying medical conditions that a person might have. They must be performed at least once in a year to keep track of your physical well-being. The blood sample is usually obtained from the arm using a hypodermic needle with little need for special preparation beforehand.",
        "In testing for certain medical conditions, it is advised that the patient does not drink or eat anything for 9-12 hours before the blood is drawn. Some medications are also prohibited before a blood test. Such tests are usually for checking liver function, blood sugar levels, kidney function, and glucose levels, etc.",
        "In summary, blood tests are one of the most important tools used by healthcare providers to diagnose their patients. After the disease or medical condition has been identified, it can be treated accordingly.",
