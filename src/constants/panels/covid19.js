      desc: [
        "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is the gold standard in diagnostics. It can detect minimal amounts of viral genetic material in a sample by duplicating it many times over through a complex laboratory process called amplification.",
        "A diagnostic test can show if you have an active coronavirus infection and should take steps to quarantine or isolate yourself from others. Currently there are two types of diagnostic tests which detect the virus – molecular tests, such as RT-PCR tests, that detect the virus’s genetic material, and antigen tests that detect specific proteins on the surface of the virus.",
        "PCR tests are used to directly detect the presence of an antigen, rather than the presence of the body’s immune response, or antibodies. By detecting viral RNA, which will be present in the body before antibodies form or symptoms of the disease are present, the tests can tell whether someone has the virus very early on.",
