Historical family patterns of certain types of cancer, along with other factors such as the age at which that cancer has typically developed, can signal inherited variant susceptibility syndrome.",
            "Turnkey Diagnostics offers a multi-gene blood draw test that accurately identifies the presence of an inherited gene mutation or alteration. A patient who receives a negative test result will benefit from peace of mind knowing they did not inherit a harmful gene variant, while a patient who receives a positive test result will benefit from opportunities to better understand and potentially manage their cancer risk, and to make important decisions about their medical care.",

            "Inherited mutations in the genes of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and EPCAM give a patient an increased lifetime risk of certain cancers. This genetic syndrome, known as Lynch syndrome and also called hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), puts patients at a higher risk of certain types of cancer.",

For women, a BRCA mutation increases the risk for breast and ovarian cancers. For men, the overall risk for cancer is lower than women, although the risk for breast, prostate and skin cancers is increased. BRCA2 gene mutations in some men, particularly at a younger age, are associated with an increased risk of lymphoma and cancers of the pancreas, stomach, bile duct and gallbladder.",
            "<strong>Family History:</strong> BRCA mutation is almost always inherited from a parent, and that parent’s family tree typically has history of early cancers, particularly breast and ovarian cancers. Importantly, however, a patient with a BRCA mutation will not necessarily develop cancer.",
            "<strong>The Importance of Testing:</strong> A patient with a BRCA mutation has a 50% chance of passing on the gene mutation to each child and a 50% chance of passing on the gene without the mutation. As a result, knowing the patient’s BRCA status is important to both the patient’s children to whom the gene mutation may have been passed, as well as the patient’s siblings who may have inherited the BRCA mutation from a parent.",
