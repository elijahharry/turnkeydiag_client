          q: "Causes",
          a: [
            "Urinary tract infections typically occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and begin to multiply in the bladder. Although the urinary system is designed to keep out such microscopic invaders, these defenses sometimes fail. When that happens, bacteria may take hold and grow into a full-blown infection in the urinary tract. The most common UTIs occur mainly in women and affect the bladder and urethra.",
            "<span style='font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 700'>Infection of the Bladder (Cystitis)</span><br />This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli), a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. However, sometimes other bacteria are responsible. Sexual intercourse may lead to cystitis, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop it. All women are at risk of cystitis because of their anatomy — specifically, the short distance from the urethra to the anus and the urethral opening to the bladder.",
            "<span style='font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 700'>Infection of the Urethra (Urethritis)</span><br />This type of UTI can occur when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. Also, because the female urethra is close to the vagina, sexually transmitted infections, such as herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma, can cause urethritis.",
          ],
        },
        {
          q: "Risk Factors",
          a: [
            "Urinary tract infections are common in women, and many women experience more than one infection during their lifetimes. Risk factors specific to women for UTIs include:",

            "<span style='font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 700;'>Female Anatomy</span><br />A woman has a shorter urethra than a man does, which shortens the distance that bacteria must travel to reach the bladder.",
            "<span style='font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 700;'>Sexual Activity</span><br />Sexually active women tend to have more UTIs than do women who aren't sexually active. Having a new sexual partner also increases your risk.",
            "<span style='font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 700;'>Certain Types of Birth Control</span><br />Women who use diaphragms for birth control may be at higher risk, as well as women who use spermicidal agents.",
            "<span style='font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 700;'>Menopause</span><br />After menopause, a decline in circulating estrogen causes changes in the urinary tract that make you more vulnerable to infection.",
            "<span style='font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 700;'>Urinary Tract Abnormalities</span><br />Babies born with urinary tract abnormalities that don't allow urine to leave the body normally or cause urine to back up in the urethra have an increased risk of UTIs.",
            "<span style='font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 700;'>Blockages in the Urinary Tract</span><br />Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder and increase the risk of UTIs.",
            "<span style='font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 700;'>A Suppressed Immune System</span><br />Diabetes and other diseases that impair the immune system — the body's defense against germs — can increase the risk of UTIs.",
            "<span style='font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 700;'>Catheter Use</span><br />People who can't urinate on their own and use a tube (catheter) to urinate have an increased risk of UTIs. This may include people who are hospitalized, people with neurological problems that make it difficult to control their ability to urinate and people who are paralyzed.",
            "<span style='font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 700;'>A Recent Urinary Procedure</span><br />Urinary surgery or an exam of your urinary tract that involves medical instruments can both increase your risk of developing a urinary tract infection.",

            "<span style='font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 700;'>Drink plenty of liquids, especially water.</span><br />Drinking water helps dilute your urine and ensures that you'll urinate more frequently — allowing bacteria to be flushed from your urinary tract before an infection can begin.",
            "<span style='font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 700;'>Drink cranberry juice.</span><br />Although studies are not conclusive that cranberry juice prevents UTIs, it is likely not harmful.",
            "<span style='font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 700;'>Wipe from front to back.</span><br />Doing so after urinating and after a bowel movement helps prevent bacteria in the anal region from spreading to the vagina and urethra.",

            "<span style='font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 700;'>Avoid potentially irritating feminine products.</span><br />Using deodorant sprays or other feminine products, such as douches and powders, in the genital area can irritate the urethra.",
            "<span style='font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 700;'>Change your birth control method.</span><br />Diaphragms, or unlubricated or spermicide-treated condoms, can all contribute to bacterial growth.",
