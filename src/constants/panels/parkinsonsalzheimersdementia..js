It represents a group of brain disorders caused by degeneration of the frontal and/or temporal lobes of the brain. FTD's estimated prevalence in the United States is around 60,000 cases, and many in the medical community remain unfamiliar with it. FTD is frequently misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's, depression, Parkinson's disease, or a psychiatric condition. On average, it currently takes 3.6 years to get an accurate diagnosis. Up to 40% of patients have a positive family history with a diagnosis of dementia in at least one extra family member. Three major causal genes have been identified: MAPT, GRN, and C9ORF72.",
