Personalized medicine is the future, but clinicians lack the tools to bring it to life, and our patients are paying the price. One person dies every 37 seconds in the United States from cardiovascular disease. A one-size-fits-all approach to heart disease clearly isn’t optimal. We believe better data leads to deeper insights, which lead to better treatment plans, which lead to better patient outcomes. Our cardiac genetic test is a comprehensive cardio genetic diagnostics service. Integrating three cutting edge diagnostic technologies enabling clinicians to truly create a data-driven personalized treatment plan for their patients.",
